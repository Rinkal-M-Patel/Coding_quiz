# Working with Web APIs: Code Quiz




## Description

The Code Quiz is a web application that challenges users to answer code-related questions within a time limit. Users can test their coding knowledge by selecting the correct answers from multiple choices. Incorrect answers will penalize their score and time. The application also provides a highscores page to display the top scores achieved by different users.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes Web APIs for handling user interactions and local storage for saving highscores.

## Lessons Learned

During the development of this project, I learned the following:

- Understanding Web APIs: I gained experience in working with Web APIs, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML elements and the Web Storage API to store and retrieve data in local storage.

- User Experience (UX) and Interaction: I learned how to create an interactive quiz that engages users and provides immediate feedback on their actions, enhancing user satisfaction.

- Project Organization: I realized the importance of organizing code efficiently, breaking it into reusable functions, and separating concerns for maintainability and scalability.

- Version Control and Collaboration: Working with Git for version control facilitated collaboration with team members and helped manage changes effectively.

- Testing and Debugging: I encountered and fixed various bugs during the development process, honing my skills in testing and debugging code.

- Continuous Learning: This project served as a reminder of the value of continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of software development.
